           <p> 
            My first and final keeper of my heart. I am so happy that you're in my life once again.
            This feels different from before. A good type of different. I'm grateful just to have you in my life in any way; as a friend, as anything. 
            But having you as my lover, as mine? That's all I ever wanted.
        
            
            </p>
            
            <p>

                I have these nights where when I'm alone with my thoughts, 
            I smile thinking about how lucky i am, how unreal this all feels, yet feels perfectly real at the same time. Like this is how it's supposed to be.
            </p>

        <p>

        I love you more than ever. And that's why it hurts sometimes, not being able to see you; not being able to touch you. 
        I never knew physical touch meant this much to me until you became mine. Now being apart from you just doesn't feel right. 
        And I'm not sure if it's just me, but it seems everywhere I go now, I see couples. I can't unsee them. THEY'RE EVERYWHERE.
         And it's annoying because it reminds me of our distance. I wanna go on walks, go to the beach, the park... 
         I literally don't care where we go as long as it's me and you."
        </p>

        <p>
        
        Isn't it funny how you became mine, I became yours, and just as quickly we came across our first obstacle - distance. 
        At first, I thought of it as my enemy. I still do, of course, because it's stopping me from being with you. 
        But when I think about how temporary this is, how these months will eventually pass... it helps. 
        Some days it feels impossible, I'll be real with you. But anything worth having is worth waiting for. 
        And baby, you are worth everything to me and more. That's how i know you are the one for me. I dont know how i went years without you. 
        Now i can't imagine not talking with you every day. 
        </p>

        
        <p>
            That was supposed to be the end of the letter. But I have so much more to say. 
            You make me smile just by looking at you. I still get nervous now and then when we talk. 
            I get upset when you're not in my arms. You're the prettiest girl I've ever seen, 
            and I wake up every morning with a smile on my face knowing I'll see your message first thing. 
            I love you so much darling. My other half.
        </p>
